Project Description*:
Mental health is a state of well-being in which a person understands his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to his or her community. Both physical and mental health are the result of a complex interplay between many individual and environmental factors, including: family history of illness and disease/genetics lifestyle and health behaviours (e.g., smoking, exercise, substance use) levels of personal and workplace stress exposure to toxins exposure to trauma personal life circumstances and history access to supports (e.g., timely healthcare, social supports) coping skills When the demands placed on someone exceed their resources and coping abilities, their mental health will be negatively affected. Two examples of common demands are: i) working long hours under difficult circumstances, and ii) caring for a chronically ill relativ or friend. Economic hardship, unemployment, underemployment and poverty also have the potential to harm mental health.
